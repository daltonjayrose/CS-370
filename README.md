**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**  
Using the supplied code for the treasure hunt game, I developed the logic for the deep Q-learning implementation to train an AI agent to learn to successfully navigate the maze and win the game using reinforcement learning.  

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**  
Computer scientists effectively solve problems by designing and creating hardware and software solutions. Computer science is important because it enables us to find solutions to complex problems that would otherwise be impossible. In the modern age, computer science influences all aspects of our lives.  

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**  
My first step to approaching a problem is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the problem. Next, I break the problem down into smaller parts and consider the requirements necessary for a solution. Next, I implement parts of the solution whilst testing each individual components. Finally, I do testing to ensure everything as a whole functions together and make changes if necessary.  

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**  
My ethical responsibilities are to maintain security, maintain privacy, comply with laws and regulations, and ensure that anything I work on cannot cause harm to the user or organization.
